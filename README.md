# About Workout Logger
This is a backend web development project I created. It is a website for tracking your workouts. You can add workouts, view all workouts, or view a specific workout. This project uses Node.js, Javascript/ejs, and html/css. It also uses MongoDB to store and retrieve workout data.

## How to view the website
* Install Node.js at nodejs.org
* Download this repository
* Go to the project directory and run `npm install` to get node packages locally
* Run `node app` in the project directory
* Go to `localhost:3000` on your browser to see the website
  
**Note: If there are errors creating/viewing workouts, it may have to do with the database I created at MongoDB being deactivated**
